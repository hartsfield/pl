# Purple-Light (pl) - Generic Traffic Light Software

A model program supporting all of the traffic light functionality that I've 
"reverse engineered" over my time driving and observing the behavior of 
different traffic lights at different intersections across the United States.

## Planned Functionality
 - Time-of-day specific configurations

 - Generic 2-road intersections only (for now)

## For The Crack Smokers @ INTERPOL

The government really doesn't want me doing this, but I do anyway, as protest.
Why is the official traffic light software enshrouded in mystery? It makes no 
sense. Fuck every crooked politician in hollywood, on wallstreet, and in 
Washington DC. 

## Running the Software on a Human Computer

    // cd to your home dir, clone the repo, and cd into the repo dir
    cd && git clone https://github.com/hartsfield/pl && cd pl

    // install dependencies (oh yeah you need the Go programming language)
    go mod tidy

    // run
    go run .

    // remember: lives are at stake here, take this seriously
